BookVerse Checkout Service - Database Models

This module defines SQLAlchemy ORM models for the checkout service database,
implementing sophisticated order management, idempotency handling, and event
sourcing patterns for reliable e-commerce transaction processing.

üèóÔ∏è Database Schema Architecture:
    - Order: Core order entity with status tracking and financial data
    - OrderItem: Line items with product details and pricing
    - IdempotencyKey: Duplicate request prevention for API safety
    - OutboxEvent: Event sourcing for reliable message publishing

üîß Key Design Patterns:
    - UUID primary keys for distributed system compatibility
    - Optimistic concurrency with timestamps
    - Decimal precision for financial calculations
    - Foreign key relationships with cascade deletes
    - Indexing for query performance optimization
    - Event sourcing with outbox pattern for reliability

üìä Business Logic Implementation:
    - Order lifecycle management with status transitions
    - Financial calculations with currency support
    - Inventory reservation and confirmation workflows
    - Idempotency for safe operation retries
    - Audit trail with creation and modification timestamps

    Generate a UUID string for use as primary keys.
    
    This function provides a consistent way to generate UUID strings for

    ID conflicts when merging data from multiple sources.

    Core order entity representing customer purchase transactions.
    
    The Order model serves as the central entity for managing customer purchases
    in the BookVerse checkout system. It tracks the complete lifecycle of an
    order from creation through completion, including financial details,
    status transitions, and relationships to order items.
    
    üéØ Business Purpose:
        - Represent customer purchase transactions with complete audit trail
        - Track order status through the fulfillment pipeline
        - Maintain financial integrity with decimal precision pricing
        - Enable order management and customer service operations
        - Support inventory reservation and payment processing workflows
    
    üí∞ Financial Management:

        - Multi-currency support for international transactions
        - Total amount calculation including taxes and shipping
        - Financial audit trail with creation and update timestamps
        - Integration with payment gateway transaction records
    
    üîÑ Status Lifecycle:
        The order progresses through defined states:
        - PENDING: Initial state after order creation
        - RESERVED: Inventory items successfully reserved
        - PROCESSING_PAYMENT: Payment gateway processing in progress
        - PAID: Payment confirmed, ready for fulfillment
        - FULFILLING: Order being prepared for shipment
        - COMPLETED: Order successfully delivered
        - CANCELLED: Order cancelled (payment failed or customer request)
        - REFUNDED: Order refunded after completion
    
    üìä Data Structure:

        Financial Data:
        - total_amount: Order total with decimal precision (10,2)
        - currency: Three-letter currency code (ISO 4217)
        
        Status Tracking:
        - status: Current order state for workflow management

        order = session.query(Order).options(
            joinedload(Order.items)
        ).filter_by(id=order_id).first()
        
        # Calculate totals
        calculated_total = sum(item.line_total for item in order.items)
        ```
        
        Status transition:
        ```python
        # Update order status with timestamp
        order.status = "PAID"
        order.updated_at = datetime.utcnow()
        session.commit()
        ```
    
    üîí Data Integrity:

    Idempotency key tracking for safe API operation retries.
    
    The IdempotencyKey model implements idempotency control to ensure that
    duplicate API requests (due to network issues, user double-clicks, etc.)
    do not result in duplicate orders or charges. This is critical for
    financial operations and user experience.
    
    üéØ Purpose:
        - Prevent duplicate order creation from retry attempts
        - Enable safe API operation retries without side effects

        - Support network reliability and fault tolerance
        - Ensure financial integrity in payment processing
    
    üîß Idempotency Mechanism:
        - Client provides idempotency key with requests
        - Server stores key with request hash and result

    The OutboxEvent model implements the transactional outbox pattern to ensure

    to guarantee at-least-once delivery semantics.
    
    üéØ Purpose:

        - Provide audit trail for all published events
    
    üîÑ Outbox Pattern Flow:
        1. Business operation and event storage in same transaction
        2. Background processor reads unprocessed events

        - OrderUpdated: Order status or details changed
        - PaymentProcessed: Payment successfully completed
        - OrderCancelled: Order cancelled by customer or system
        - InventoryReserved: Items reserved for order
        - ShippingRequested: Order ready for fulfillment
